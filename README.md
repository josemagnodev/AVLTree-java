# AVL Tree Implementation in Java

## Overview

This repository contains a Java implementation of an AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree, a self-balancing binary search tree. AVL trees ensure that the height of the tree remains balanced, making operations such as insertions, deletions, and searches more efficient.
